        <h1>Ian Gallagher</h1>
        <p>
          Hey there. Welcome to my personal website. I grew up in the town of
          Felton tucked away in the redwoods of the Santa Cruz mountains. After
          going to college in San Luis Obispo, I spent some time living in
          Bozeman before moving back to California. Currently living in the town
          of Truckee just a half hour away from Lake Tahoe. My main experiences
          are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bachelor's in <b>Pure Mathematics</b> with a minor in
            <b>Computer Science</b> from Cal Poly.
          </li>
          <li>Software team member of the Cal Poly Cubesat Laboratory.</li>
          <li>
            Undergraduate student research with Dr. Charles Camp studying
            behavior of existing nonlinear models of ice age dynamics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Undergraduate student research on structure of generalized
            quaternions over the real numbers and finite fields. Advised by Dr.
            Eric Brussel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Software engineering consultant working on frontend and backend
            systems.
          </li>
          <li>Big mountain ski team coach (Freeride discipline).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I enjoy mathematics, technology, skiing, running and hiking as well as
          many other outdoor activities. I am also looking to do more
          backcountry skiing and backpacking in the coming months and year.
        </p>

        <h1>Future plans</h1>
        <p>
          I will be attending a PhD program for applied mathematics in the fall
          of 2024. My current goals are to study mathemematical modeling
          techniques and nonlinear systems dynamics with applications to
          physical and biological systems.
